# <code-quiz>

## Description
- For this project I was tasked to create a code quiz using JavaScript HTML and CSS.
- My motivation for this project was so I can challenge myself and to try to fully understand JavaScript because this project is the one that has made me pull my hair out the most out of all my previous projects.
- The reason I built and edited this assignment was because I need to be able to have a quiz outline that I can add to in the future to add even more question to and use as a possible tool for studying.
- During this project I learned how to problem solve on my own by using resources such as google and AI tools to give me a better understanding of things I just cant seem to grasp, as well as getting advice and help from friends and or T/A's from the class and comparing code with other code I already had to see why something did or did not work.
